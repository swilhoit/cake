3D Model Files

To properly display 3D cake models, you need to add the following .glb files to this directory:

1. cake_model_2.glb - High quality model for desktop
2. cake_model_low.glb - Lower quality model for mobile
3. cake_model_very_low.glb - Very low quality model for low-end devices

You can create these files using Blender or other 3D modeling software, or download existing cake models from sources like:
- https://sketchfab.com/
- https://free3d.com/
- https://www.turbosquid.com/

For now, we're using fallback images when 3D models can't be loaded.
